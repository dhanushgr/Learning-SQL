Data Models

-- Syntax and Examples
-- Relational Model
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Hierarchical Model (Pseudo-SQL)
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    parent_dept_id INT
);

-- Network Model (Pseudo-SQL)
CREATE TABLE emp_projects (
    emp_id INT,
    proj_id INT
);

-- Explanation Section
-- Hi! Data models are like different ways to organize your toy collection—each has its own style! The Relational Model is SQL’s favorite—it uses tables like employees, with rows and columns, connected by keys (like emp_id). It’s super flexible, like sorting toys into labeled boxes you can link up. The Hierarchical Model is a family tree—one parent (like a department) has kids (sub-departments), all nested like branches. It’s strict but great for simple top-down stuff. The Network Model is a spider web—things like employees and projects can connect any which way, not just up and down. It’s messier but powerful for crisscross links. Relational wins in SQL because it’s easy to query and mix—tables are like puzzle pieces that fit together however you want!
